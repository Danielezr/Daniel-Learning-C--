My name is Daniel Espinoza and I'm a Computer Science student and I created this repository to save all the code I did while learning to code in C++. The exercises were assigned to me through ChatGPT, a C++ YouTube course from the "Programacion ATS" channel and projects solved in the "Metodos de Programacion" class at CETYS University.
